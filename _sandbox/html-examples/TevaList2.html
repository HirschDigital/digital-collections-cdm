                                    a montage of notable Nashville attractions, displays sites that remain just as

                                <p>Although postcard collecting enjoyed its highest popularity around the turn of the
                                    twentieth century,
                                    the practice of sending postcards began around 1870. Deltiology, or postcard
                                    collecting, became a
                                    popular way of documenting people’s travels or of sharing images of one’s hometown
                                    with others. In the
                                    early twentieth century, postcards with "divided backs" allowed printers to devote
                                    one entire side of
                                    the card to an image. The reverse side was then split between an area reserved for a
                                    message and an
                                    area for the recipient’s address. Previously, senders wrote their message on the
                                    image side of the
                                    card, with the reverse completely devoted to the recipient’s address. This new form
                                    of postcard
                                    encouraged the so-called "Golden Age" of postcards, roughly considered as the years
                                    1895-1920.</p>

                                <p>According to writer Tom Phillips (The Postcard Century, 2000), deltiologists divide
                                    postcards into
                                    three categories: topography, subject, and artists. Postcard collectors highly prize
                                    cards that were
                                    produced by specific artists or photographers, especially limited runs of particular
                                    happenings,
                                    areas, or people. The "real photo" postcard remains a highly-sought form of postcard
                                    that enjoyed
                                    widespread popularity in the early 20th century. "Real photocards" allowed
                                    individuals to fashion
                                    unique correspondence that carried one-of-a-kind images. Special cameras,
                                    manufactured by the Eastman
                                    Kodak Company (see Image 4), enabled users to produce photographs sturdy enough to
                                    be sent through the
                                    mail. Few, if any, of the postcards in this collection appear to be this form of
                                    card.</p>

                                <p>Postcard enthusiasts enjoy the hobby for many different reasons, but several
                                    important aspects of
                                    deltiology can explain its popularity. Postcards that have been mailed are easily
                                    dateable: most
                                    postmarks display the day and city in which the card was sent. Additionally,
                                    postcard printing methods
                                    have changed so often over the years that the certain quality and texture of card
                                    can often be traced
                                    to a definite time period. Postcard collecting is also a comparatively cheap hobby,
                                    and many people
                                    buy the cards as souvenirs without any intent to mail them to friends or family
                                    members. Another
                                    attractive aspect of deltiology is the democratic nature of postcards; they depict
                                    virtually
                                    everything and have been sent or received by every demographic of people in many
                                    different countries.
                                    Many active clubs around the country and throughout the world still promote the art
                                    of the postcard
                                    and the hobby of collecting postcards. Postcrossing, an online postcard club, allows
                                    members to
                                    exchange postcards with individuals from all over the world. Postcard organizations
                                    in metropolitan
                                    areas of the U.S. often hold monthly meetings for members to share their collections
                                    with others who
                                    enjoy the hobby.</p>
