                    some of the many individuals whose lives were directly impacted by this unlikely school.</p>
                <p>In the faces of the students and teachers of Southland College, we glimpse more than sixty
                    years of African-American experiences, aspirations, and triumphs. The United States
                    underwent tremendous transformation from the era of slavery into the 20th century. Thousands
                    of students and hundreds of teachers passed through the humble wooden structures nine miles
                    northwest of Helena, Arkansas. Many of the students themselves became teachers, as Southland
                    quickly included a Normal School curriculum and extended its educational mission across the
                    country.</p>

                <p>Southland College had its genesis as the Helena Orphan Asylum and bore the singular
                    distinction of being the first institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi River
                    for African Americans. That this occurred in Phillips County, Arkansas – perhaps best known
                    for one of the worst race riots in the nation's history, the Elaine Massacre of 1919 –
                    underscores the significance of this unparalleled endeavor.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>Southland's evolution into a college was not part of an initial, thoughtful strategy
                            to systemically assist the African-American population of the region. Originally
                            established by Quakers from Indiana as an orphanage for refugee slave children while
                            the Civil War still raged, the Friends' Freedmen Committee appointed Calvin and
                            Alida Clark to form a school on April 19, 1864. The earliest buildings came through
                            donations and the voluntary labor of the 56th U.S. Colored Infantry regiment during
                            Reconstruction. Within ten years, Southland's enrollment grew to more than 200
                            students under the Clarks' guidance, and the Indiana Yearly Meeting of the Quakers
                            made the school a diploma-granting institution in 1876. Southland made great strides
                            toward satiating the overwhelming longing for literacy felt by former slaves and
                            addressed the acute need for educated teachers and professionals around the country
                            as the African Americans of the Delta moved in search of greater opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The impact of Southland College is not quantifiable. Hundreds of students graduated
                            with teaching degrees. Recognizing the fruits of educating just one exceptional
                            woman, however, provides some perspective on the magnitude of the school's legacy.
                            Anna Strong (1884–1966), a 1903 graduate of Southland, exemplifies the
                            transformative power of education initiated by the school. Before her election as
                            president of the Arkansas State Teachers Association, her creation of the Key
                            School's Program for the Arkansas Department of Education, or the other numerous
                            honors she received, Strong was a student at Southland. She began teaching others at
                            age thirteen, and after finishing degrees at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and
                            Columbia University, Strong returned to the Arkansas Delta to become principal of
                            the Robert Moton School in Marianna in Lee County, where she served for 30 years
                            until 1957, a career that began in the darkest depths of segregation and saw the
                            first signs of school integration.</p>
                        <p>Southland reached its peak enrollment, approaching 500 students, in 1917. After
                            several changes in name and direction by national Quaker groups, lingering financial
                            problems eventually caused Southland College to close in 1925, despite the pleas of
                            Strong and other supporters and alumni to see their beloved school continue to
                            nurture generations of African Americans from the South. Despite this heartbreaking
                            loss, the decades of work and the resulting improbable education of so many
                            individuals remains a victory originated in the devastation of the Civil War.</p>

                <p>The University Libraries project team was composed of Catherine Wallack, Project Curator;
                    Deborah E. Kulczak, Head of Technical Services and Database Maintenance; Martha Parker,
                    Digital Services Librarian; and Alyssa Willis, Cataloging Librarian.</p>
                <p>Images were digitized and processed by the Digital Services Unit personnel, including the
                    Digital Services Unit Coordinator, Lee A. Holt, Wendy McLean, Alexa Shephard, Rachel Ross,
                    Jayleen Serrano, and Alejandra Rubio using an Epson Expression 10000XL flatbed scanner, a
                    Contex HD Ultra 42” scanner, and Silver Fast Scanning software. Optical character
                    recognition (OCR) was added using ABBYY FineReader. Image optimization was performed using
                    Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Acrobat; transcripts were created and encoded using Notepad++.
                    CONTENTdm digital asset management software from OCLC was used to create metadata, using
                    Dublin Core standards, Library of Congress Name Authorities, the Art and Architectural
                    Thesaurus, and the University of Arkansas Libraries CONTENTdm Cookbook. Dylan Hurd and Beth
                    Juhl from Web Services contributed to the webpage design. The project was completed May
                    2017.</p>
                <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
                <p>This project would not have existed without the multifold efforts of Dr. Thomas C. Kennedy, a
                    longtime professor at the University of Arkansas's Department of History. A historian of
                    Britain and Quakers, Kennedy played the central role in the transfer of the Southland Papers
                    to the University of Arkansas Libraries' Special Collections. Kennedy's thorough and
                    thoughtful scholarship and his publication of <em><a
                            href="http://www.uapress.com/dd-product/a-history-of-southland-college/">A History
                            of Southland College</a></em> brought to light the chronicle of this singular
                    institution when the story was in danger of being forgotten. His diligence will continue to
                    benefit researchers for the foreseeable future. We are indebted.</p>
