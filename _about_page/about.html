                <h2>Purpose and Mission</h2>
                <p>The libraries of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston are dedicated to providing access to its special
                    collections through imaging and metadata creation.  We are committed to supporting the scholarly
                    needs of new audiences as well as our existing communities, including staff, scholars, artists,
                    students, and the public as they pursue unique or distinctive elements of our research collections.
                    <br>The libraries will prioritize materials that support museum research needs while secondarily
                    supporting the needs of the broader art research community. We will oversee the selection, creation,
                    delivery, and preservation of these digital collections, while welcoming input concerning the
                    selection process to meet patron demands. As appropriate, the libraries will partner with other
                    museum departments and external entities to support these efforts.
                    <br>Materials considered for digitization are items held in the collections of the Hirsch and Powell
                    Libraries. We will also provide access to born digital materials created by the MFAH and by local
                    entities that are relevant to the museum’s research needs. </p>
